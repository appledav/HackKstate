Hack K-State Project


This project was intended to be a bigger part of a solution. Originally, my partner and I developed our own solutions. 
Mine was supposed to be able to store and retrieve data from a secure file somewhere on the computer, where you would store
passwords and login information for a variety of different websites. Obviously this is not super practical or safe, but in 
principle, the design works. My partner developed a solution to be able to utilize Twilio, to be able to text the database and 
access the information from your phone. With hours of debugging later, we found that mixing our two projects did not go nearly as 
planned, so we decided to split our work into 2 seperate projects, with mine being just a simple file storage system. 

There is not much error checking, nor security, but that was not the principle of this project. I am happy with the functionality 
and I hope you find the userface easy to use. As simple as this project is, it is the first solo project I have ever worked on. The 
state it is in is something I am satisfied with for the moment, but would never be able to be taken to the professional level. If you 
are like me and forget your passwords as often as I do, this could be very useful in keeping track of everything. With a simple 
decryption step, this can be easily applied for any use, but I will leave that up to you to develop. 

Thank you,
